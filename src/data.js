        question: 'What is wildlife conservation?',
        answer: 'Wildlife conservation is the practice of protecting animal species and their habitats, but it is mostly used in refence to species that are endangered. All animals play an important role in the ecosystem. If one species goes extinct, or a habitat is damaged because of deforestation or pollution it threatens the entire food chain and ecosystem.',

        description2: 'If you see something, take a photo pinning the location of the incident,\
         make sure you know the facts before buying animal products or parts and help to reduce the demand by simply saying no.\
         Be a responsible tourist and support genuine eco-tourism as it provides income for local communities reducing their reliance on other activities that negatively impact wildlife or habitats',

        description3: 'Defined as the unsustainable practice of killing endangered species due to their rarity and perceived economic value, the illegal wildlife trade has a \
        devastating impact on biodiversity and state stability.\ It is the greatest immediate threat to the future of many of our most iconic species, with over 27,000 elephants \
        and more than 1,000 rhinos killed every year. More quietly, we face the permanent loss of fauna as diverse as pangolins and tortoises. Animals are being killed or taken from \
        the wild to be sold for medicines, luxury food, trophy parts, restaurant dishes, fashion items and pets.The illegal wildlife trade is the fourth most lucrative transnational \
        crime after drugs, arms and human trafficking and is valued by the UN Environment Programme at $23 billion US a year – twice the gross domestic product of commonly poached \
        countries such as Tanzania or Kenya.',

        description4: 'Southeast Asia is a global hotspot for wildlife crime; not only does this region have more plants and animals threatened by trade than\
         anywhere else; it is also a major trade hub for a multitude of species from around the globe. Open wildlife markets continue to flourish, and increasingly, so does the online \
         trade in wildlife.\In partnership with TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, we have created Wildlife Witness; the first global community action tool in the fight \
         against illegal wildlife trade.\The Wildlife Witness smartphone app allows tourists and locals to easily report wildlife trade by taking a photo, pinning the exact location of \
         an incident and sending these important details to TRAFFIC. \Reports are analysed by a Wildlife Crime Data Analyst and credible incidents referred to enforcement agencies for \
         action. This process helps prioritise response actions, builds data that improves understanding of illegal wildlife trade and highlights areas for increased enforcement resources.\
         You never know when you may witness wildlife crime - markets and shops across Southeast Asia are wildlife trade hotspots. With over 1.2 million Aussies holidaying in Indonesia alone \
         each year, everyone knows someone who will be travelling that can lend their eyes to the wild. So share the Wildlife Witness app with your friends and family and let’s be the \
         generation that puts an end to illegal wildlife trade.'

        description1: 'The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) announced in 2009 by HRA aimed to address both policy frameworks and specific measures for better planning and coordination in the sustainable use, \
        management and conservation of Singapore’s biodiversity, taking into consideration the country’s national priorities as well as its international and regional obligations. The action plan was updated in 2019, incorporating input from \
        various public sector agencies and nature groups. Close to 10 percent of Singapore’s total land area would be set aside for parks and nature conservation, up from the 5 percent proposed in the 1992 Singapore Green Plan.',

        description2: 'In 2015, HRA launched the Nature Conservation Masterplan to chart the course of Singapore’s future biodiversity conservation efforts. It aimed to “systematically consolidate, coordinate, strengthen and intensify the biodiversity conservation efforts outlined in the NBSAP”.',

        description3: 'More recently, in 2021, the Singapore Green Plan 2030 – spearheaded by government ministeries in charge of education, national development, sustainability and the environment, trade and industry, and transport – was unveiled.35 One of the key pillars in the green plan is the “City in Nature” strategy. \
        This means that by 2030, Singapore would have an additional 1,000 hectares of green spaces and 160 km of park connectors, every household would live within a 10-minute walk from a park, and 1 million more trees would be planted across the island.A more consolidated approach towards nature conservation emerged with the \
        formation of NParks in 1990 to manage the national parks, then comprising the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Fort Canning Park and the nature reserves.',

        description4: 'The law aimed to protect and preserve flora and fauna in the nature reserves and provide opportunities for their study and research within the natural environment in which they live. The ordinance evolved into the Nature Reserves Act in 1985, which was repealed and replaced by the National Parks Act in 1990. \
        With growing awareness and calls for the conservation of nature areas, Singapore currently has 24 nature areas comprising the four main nature reserves – Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve and Labrador Nature Reserve – as well as 20 other areas that are subject to\
         administrative safeguards under the Parks and Waterbodies Plan. The four nature reserves are protected under the Parks and Trees Act.',

        description1: 'Project AWARE describe themselves as a global force of divers. The organisation works with scuba divers across the globe to protect underwater environments. To date, they and their members have removed 966,546 bits of debris from the ocean across 182 countries. Members are encouraged to join Project Aware so that,\
         every time they dive, they can give something back and preserve the environment for future generations.',

        description2: 'The negative impact of rubbish and plastics in our waterways was expertly highlighted by the Blue Planet series, but here are some terrifying facts to bring it home. More than 250 million tons of plastic are estimated to be found in our oceans by 2025 and the environmental damage caused by plastic debris alone is estimated \
        to cost 13 billion USD per annum causing marine animals become entangled in debris, and even mistake it for food – with often fatal results.',

        description3: 'Project AWARE campaigns and works closely with partner organisations to clean up the oceans and to improve legislation to protect them. Most importantly, they encourage divers to come with them on this conservation journey and to actively help out whenever they go diving. They encourage certified divers to collect data as they dive,\
         remove marine debris and report the results. Dive surveys take place frequently, where passionate divers can meet up and help to collect this valuable data, which can subsequently be used in campaigns to make a change in the future.',

        description4: `PADI Professionals have a long and successful history of working with divers with disabilities. PADI's approach to diver education is (and always has been) inclusive: Everyone who meets a course's prerequisites is welcome to enroll. The PADI Adaptive Techniques Specialty course builds on that foundation by enhancing the training PADI Professionals receive, and preparing them for student-centered and prescriptive approaches when adapting techniques to meet diver needs.\
                Our approach to corporate social responsibility is built upon the organization’s long and enduring legacy to protect the underwater world that we love. As the largest network of dive centers, dive instructors and divers, we have a tremendous opportunity to mobilize millions of PADI Torchbearers to save the ocean.`,

        description1: 'Tigers are one of the world’s most recognized animals. Throughout history they can be seen in cultural traditions across Asia, as well as in brand images and logos the world over. But while they might be omnipresent across our cultural landscape, their actual existence in the wild has been dramatically reduced to only a few pockets of their historical range. \
        Wild tigers are now found in just 10 countries, their historical range shrunk by over 95%. Once widespread in Singapore, the tiger population has declined drastically over the last decade. If tigers completely disappeared, we’d be losing so much more than an iconic species',

        description2: ' Very little information is current on the number of tigers remaining. However, non-targeted rapid camera trapping surveys conducted by HRA over the last three years has confirmed the presence of several adult male and female tigers along with a healthy prey base and would indicate that this region will likely be considered a “Global Priority” Tiger Conservation Landscape, designated\
         as the highest priority for wild tiger conservation. On-going surveys continue to be conducted in the Dawna-Karen Hills to obtain further data on the abundance of tigers and other high profile Critically Endangered species.',

        description3: 'Results have so far captured more photographic evidence of tigers and an abundant prey base, as determined by the number of principal prey species photographed. With support from IUCN-KfW funding, HFA is currently implementing a project under the Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme (ITHCP). This project aims to secure protected areas in the Dawna-Karen Hills to ensure no further decrease in the tiger population and the opportunity for the tiger numbers to recover.The project incorporates the expansion of Wildlife Protection Units \
        to additional protected areas and builds support within the KNU leadership and local communities for the implementation of tiger management practices in the region. As well as the provision of equipment to the ranger teams, the project will see the construction of three new ranger stations, ongoing SMART training for field staff and full feasibility studies for future investment in livelihood development.',

        description4: 'Further expansion and ongoing support of our WPU is essential to ensure maximum coverage of rangers within these high-value forests. The teams also require ongoing training and the supply of equipment and tools to enable them to operate under difficult conditions. We invite you to support our WPU teams by making a contribution towards their training, equipment and salaries. Your donation will \
        help to keep these rangers in the field and save the lives of the critically endangered species they protect.',
